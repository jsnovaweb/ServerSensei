====================================================================
Cross-Platform Server Monitor & Optimizer - Build Instructions
====================================================================

This application is designed to be packaged into standalone executables
for Windows, macOS, and Linux using PyInstaller.

PREREQUISITES:
==============
1. Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system
2. PyInstaller: pip install pyinstaller
3. Required dependencies: pip install psutil matplotlib

BUILDING EXECUTABLES:
=====================

For Windows (.exe):
-------------------
1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run: pyinstaller build_windows.spec
4. Find executable in: dist/SystemMonitor.exe

For macOS (.app):
-----------------
1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run: pyinstaller build_macos.spec
4. Find application bundle in: dist/SystemMonitor.app

For Linux (binary):
-------------------
1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run: pyinstaller build_linux.spec
4. Find executable in: dist/SystemMonitor

ALTERNATIVE - Simple Build (One File):
======================================
If you want a simpler build without spec files:

pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name=SystemMonitor main.py

This creates a single executable file in dist/ directory.

CREATING AppImage (Linux):
==========================
For Linux AppImage distribution:

1. Build the Linux executable first (as above)
2. Install appimagetool: 
   wget https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/releases/download/continuous/appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage
   chmod +x appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage
3. Create AppDir structure:
   mkdir -p SystemMonitor.AppDir/usr/bin
   cp dist/SystemMonitor SystemMonitor.AppDir/usr/bin/
4. Create desktop file and icon (optional)
5. Run: ./appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage SystemMonitor.AppDir

TESTING:
========
Before building, test the application by running:
python main.py

The application should launch with a GUI showing system monitoring
dashboard, process manager, optimization tools, device manager, and
system information tabs.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============
- If modules are missing, run: pip install -r requirements.txt
  (Create requirements.txt with: pip freeze > requirements.txt)
- On Linux, if GUI doesn't show, install: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
- On macOS, ensure Xcode Command Line Tools are installed
- For permission errors on optimization features, run with administrator/sudo

DISTRIBUTION:
=============
- Windows: Distribute the .exe file (may need to allow through antivirus)
- macOS: Distribute the .app bundle (may need code signing for Gatekeeper)
- Linux: Distribute the binary or AppImage file (chmod +x before running)

NOTES:
======
- The first run may take a few seconds as dependencies are verified
- Administrator/root privileges required for some optimization features
- Antivirus software may flag the executable - this is common for PyInstaller apps
- File size will be 50-100MB due to bundled Python interpreter and libraries
